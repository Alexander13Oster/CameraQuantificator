# Hardware

DoIt Esp32 Board
25 RGB LED Strip with WS2812B LEDÂ´s

# Setup

Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

## Install Esp32 Driver

In Arduino IDE go to `Preferences`

On Windows add additional driver from `https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads`; download and install as known. Not needed for Mac.

## NeoPixel Library 

To control the lights we need the Neopixel library.

Go to the Library Manager and search for `adafruit neopixel` and install it.

Search for `doit` in the Boards search field, select the Devkit one without Arduino suffix and selecte a Port. If you can not determine which port is the right one try one after another, just repeat this steps with another port.

Now you should be ready to compile and upload code to your esp32

# Workflow

Open Project 'light_controller.ino' in Arduino SDK

Change SSID and Password to your network

	const char* ssid = "";
	const char* password = "";

Upload to Esp32
    Press Boot Button on Esp32 when compilation finishes and uploading beginns, in console output it starts connecting at this moment
